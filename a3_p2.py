a ="5"
b = int(3)
print(a*b) # prints out a, b times instead of a*b due to difference in data type
i= "5"
j= "4"
print(i+j) # it concatenates i and j instead of adding them up
w="9"
v= float(7.5)
print =((w*v))
# it is not possible to multiply a float by a string.
# this can be fixed by defining a data type of "float" or "int".
